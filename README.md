My First HTML Project less go!

In this project I will be creating a basic html recipe page. It will contain links to other html pages that will have images and websites etc. Basically a recipe book.

In this project, I will demonstrate the following:
-Using HTML element tags
-using links(both absolute and relative)
-using images 
-using headers 
-making my text bold or italic 
Just HTML basics I have learned so far
